# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Destroy all records from tables before executing the rest of the seed code so tables don't get too big while experimenting with project. 
# This doesn't overwrite ID numbers. Can use "rake db:reset" instead of destroy_all to drop database, run migrations, then run seed file. No need to run "rake db:migration" or "rake db:seed" in that case.
